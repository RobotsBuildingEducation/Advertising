Hello people from Patreon. This is Sheilfer from RO.B.E. I started this app because I like turtles. The reason I'm reaching out to you all is because I can't swim. Buy dog coins. Thank you all for coming to my ted talk, it's been a privilege being able to deliver this message to you guys. To conclude, here is a speech by Abraham Lincoln.

```
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this 
continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to 
the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that 
nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long 
endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have 
come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place 
for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It 
is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we 
can not hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who 
struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add 
or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we 
say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us 
the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which 
they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for 
us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from 
these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which 
they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve 
that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, 
shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, 
by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
```
